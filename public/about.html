<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a widowed mom of three awesome kids. Wian is 17 and in Grade 11, Luan is 15 and in Grade 9 and Mieke is 10 and in Grade 4.
  We live in White River, Mpumalanga, South Africa in a beautiful wildlife estate, Likweti Bushveld
  Farm Estate with our 5 dogs and a beautiful black cat. As I've been a farmer's wife before my husband
  passed, I learned to be a jack of all trades and so I have a quite divers working experience.

<p>Coding is a passion that I didn't know I have until quite late in my life. I've always been mesmerized
  by technology in general. I think my love for coding is that it combines to attributes that I love in life,
  structure and creativity. While that might sound like a paradox, I feel that it describes coding perfectly.
  You have the structure of the written code and also the creativity that comes with creating something exceptional.
